'''
1.	Write a program to generate a fancy number for a new vehicle considering the following constraints:
a.	The fancy number should have 4-digits.
b.	The sum of these 4-digits should be 12.
c.	The 3rd digit should be equal to the difference between the 1st and the 2nd digit.
d.	The 4th digit should be equal to the sum of the 1st and the 3rd digit.
